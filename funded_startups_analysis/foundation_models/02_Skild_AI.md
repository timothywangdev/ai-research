## 🎯 WHAT THEY'RE BUILDING

### "Skild Brain" - Scalable Foundation Model

**Core Claim**: "1,000x more data than competing models"

**Technical Approach**:
1. **Massive Data Collection**: Training on 1,000x more data points than competitors
2. **Shared Foundation Model**: One brain for diverse robots, tasks, scenarios
3. **Capabilities**: Manipulation, locomotion, navigation (all three)
4. **Hardware Agnostic**: Works across different robot embodiments

**Key Differentiator**:
- **Scale of Training Data**: Claims largest robotics dataset ever
- **Not task-specific**: General-purpose across manipulation, mobility, navigation
- **Carnegie Mellon provenance**: Founded by CMU professors (top robotics program)

---

## 🏢 TEAM

### Co-Founders
- **Deepak Pathak**: Co-founder, ex-CMU professor (RL, robotics)
- **Abhinav Gupta**: Co-founder, ex-CMU professor, ex-Facebook AI Research

### Team Quality: A++
- Both founders left CMU professorships to start Skild
- Pathak: Famous for self-supervised RL research

## 💪 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

### 1. Data Scale (Biggest Claim)
- **"1,000x more data"** than competitors
- If true, this is insurmountable advantage
- **Question**: Where did they get this data?
  - CMU robotics lab (20+ years of data)
  - Partnerships with robot companies
  - Simulation at scale

### 2. CMU Provenance
- CMU = #1 robotics program in the world
- Access to CMU research + talent pipeline
- Credibility with technical buyers

### 3. Multi-Modal Capabilities
- Manipulation + Locomotion + Navigation (all three)
- Physical Intelligence: Mostly manipulation
- **Broader scope = larger TAM**

### 4. Capital + Valuation
- $1.5B valuation after $300M raise
- SoftBank negotiating $500M @ $4B
- **War chest to outspend competitors**

---

## ⚠️ RISKS & CHALLENGES

### 1. "1,000x Data" Claim Unverified
- No public dataset release
- Physical Intelligence claims "massive data" too
- **Risk**: Marketing vs reality gap

### 2. Same Risks as Physical Intelligence
- Google competition
- OpenAI entry
- Real-world reliability (60-80% vs 95% needed)
- Hardware fragmentation

### 3. Revenue Timeline Pressure
- $300M raised, $0 revenue
- SoftBank known for growth pressure
- **Risk**: Forced to scale before product-market fit

### 4. CMU Conflict
- Founders left CMU professorships
- Potential IP disputes
- **Risk**: University lawsuit (precedent: Google/Waymo spin-outs)

## 🎯 THREAT LEVEL TO OUR OPPORTUNITIES

### ControlNet (#3)
**Threat Level**: 🔴 **EXISTENTIAL** (same as Physical Intelligence)

**Why**:
- Skild AI IS another ControlNet competitor
- $300M raised (vs our $3-5M budget)
- CMU team (A++ provenance)
- Claims 1,000x more data
- **Combined with Physical Intel, foundation model market = saturated**

**Validation**:
- Two companies ($300M + $470M = $770M) doing exact same thing
- Both valued at $1.5-2.4B in < 12 months
- **Proves**: Foundation models for robotics = hot market BUT also crowded
- **Confirms**: We can't compete (late to market, underfunded, no team)

### Key Learning
- Foundation model space has 2-3 well-funded players ALREADY
- Physical Intelligence ($470M), Skild AI ($300M), Genesis AI ($105M)
- **Total**: $900M raised in foundation models in 12 months
- Window = closed (not 18 months as we thought)

## 💡 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### Skild AI vs Physical Intelligence (Head-to-Head)

| Factor | Physical Intelligence | Skild AI | Winner |
|--------|---------------------|----------|--------|
| **Funding** | $470M | $300M → $800M | Skild (if B closes) |
| **Valuation** | $2.4B | $1.5B → $4B | Skild (if B closes) |
| **Team** | Ex-Google | Ex-CMU | Tie (both A++) |
| **Data** | RT-X insider | "1,000x more" | Unknown |
| **Open Source** | π0 released | Not yet | Physical Intel |
| **Focus** | Manipulation | Manip + Loco + Nav | Skild (broader) |
| **Investors** | Bezos, OpenAI | Bezos, SoftBank | Skild (SoftBank growth) |

**Verdict**: Both strong, winner unclear (may both succeed or both get acquired)

### What This Means for Market

**Platform Play = Multiple Winners Unlikely**
- Foundation models = winner-take-most
- OpenAI/Anthropic = 2 winners (exception, not rule)
- **Prediction**: One gets acquired, one dominates, rest fail

**Most Likely Scenario**:
1. Physical Intel gets acquired by Amazon (Bezos connection)
2. Skild AI goes independent (SoftBank growth capital)
3. Genesis AI gets acquired by Nvidia (simulation tie-in)
4. All others fail to raise next round

## 📊 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

### Valuation Trajectory
- **Jul 2024**: $1.5B (Series A)
- **Jan 2025**: $4B (Series B negotiation)
- **6-month growth**: 2.7x
- **Implied**: 5.4x annual valuation growth

### Burn Rate (Estimated)
- Team: 50+ × $300K = $15M/year
- Compute: $10M+/year ("1,000x data" = massive compute)
- **Total burn**: $30-40M/year
- **Runway**: 7-10 years (plenty)

### Exit Scenarios

**Acquisition**: $5-10B (3-5 years)
- Amazon (Bezos invested)
- SoftBank portfolio company (Vision Fund M&A)
- Google (defensive acquisition)

**IPO**: $10-20B (5-7 years)
- Requires: $200M+ ARR
- SoftBank playbook: Push for IPO

**Failure**: <10% (SoftBank will keep funding)

## ✅ FINAL VERDICT

**Competition Level**: 🔴 **EXISTENTIAL THREAT** to ControlNet

**Our Decision**: ✅ **CORRECT TO REMOVE CONTROLNET**

**Why**:
1. Skild AI + Physical Intelligence = $770M raised in foundation models
2. Both valued at $1.5-4B (market validation + barrier to entry)
3. CMU + ex-Google teams = A++ talent (we can't compete)
4. "1,000x data" claim = data moat (we don't have)
5. SoftBank backing = unlimited capital (will outspend anyone)

**Combined Threat**:
- Physical Intelligence: $470M, ex-Google, Bezos
- Skild AI: $300M → $800M, ex-CMU, SoftBank
- Genesis AI: $105M (simulation-based)
- **Total**: $1.4B raised in foundation models for robotics
- **Window**: Closed (not 18 months, already saturated)

**Key Insight**:
- We thought: "18-month window before Google/OpenAI notice"
- Reality: 3 startups raised $1.4B in 12 months (market already noticed)
- VCs were right: "Can't compete" (they knew this was coming)

---

**This validates our ControlNet removal 100%.**
**We would've been startup #4 trying to raise $3-5M in a market where leaders have $300-470M.**
**DOA (Dead On Arrival).**
