# Fundraising Strategy - DexterData

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-14

---

## Fundraising Philosophy

**Recommendation**: Bootstrap as long as possible, raise only when hitting growth constraints.

**Why**:
- Capital-efficient validation ($13.5K total)
- Revenue starts Month 6 ($100K+ in 6 months)
- High margins (50-90%) = sustainable without funding
- Maintain control + optionality

**When to raise**: If demand exceeds capacity OR want to accelerate.

## Alternative Path: Bootstrap + NSF SBIR

**Phase I** ($50K, Month 3-12):
- Proposal: "Crowdsourced Dexterous Manipulation Data Collection for Robotics"
- Use for: Initial data collection, validation
- Equity: None (non-dilutive)

**Phase II** ($500K, Month 12-24):
- Proposal: "Scaling Dexterous Manipulation Dataset to 1M Hours"
- Use for: Platform development, scaling collection
- Equity: None

**Phase IIB** ($1M, Month 24-36):
- Proposal: "Foundation Model for Dexterous Manipulation"
- Use for: DexterNet training
- Equity: None

**Total**: $1.55M non-dilutive funding

**Advantages**:
- ✅ No equity dilution
- ✅ Validates technology (government stamp of approval)
- ✅ Slower but founder keeps control
- ✅ Can still raise VC later if needed

**Disadvantages**:
- ⏱ Slower (18-24 month application process)
- 📝 Bureaucracy (reporting requirements)
- 🎯 Limits commercial flexibility (must hit milestones)

## Pitch Deck Structure (Seed Round)

**Slide 1: Cover**
- "DexterData: The Largest Dexterous Manipulation Dataset for Humanoid Robots"
- Tagline: "Robotics' web scraping moment"

**Slide 2: Problem**
- Foundation models need millions of demos
- Teleoperation costs $50-200/hour
- $420K per robot task = unsustainable
- Existing datasets lack finger tracking (gripper-only)

**Slide 3: Solution**
- Pay gig workers $2-4/hour for everyday tasks
- Capture finger-level manipulation data (Rokoko gloves)
- 10-40× cheaper than teleoperation
- Release free dataset → monetize services

## Investor FAQ (Be Prepared)

**Q: Why won't Scale AI crush you?**
A: Different business (annotation vs collection), robotics is niche/complex for them, we have 18-month head start + deeper robotics expertise.

**Q: What if simulation wins?**
A: Sim2real gap unlikely to fully close, we pivot to validation service, real data always needed for final tuning.

**Q: How defensible is this?**
A: Data flywheel + reputation + user network = 24-36 months to replicate. Moderate moat, but execution game.

**Q: Why can't customers build in-house?**
A: Break-even at 100K+ demos/year. For <100K, outsourcing to us is cheaper (no hiring, faster, higher quality).

**Q: What's the exit?**
A: Acquisition by Physical Intelligence/Skild/NVIDIA/Amazon at $300M-1B in Year 5-7. Or bootstrap to profitability.

**Q: Why are margins so high?**
A: Premium tier is software (90% margin), custom collection has scale economies, gig workers cheap vs US labor.

**Q: Customer concentration risk?**
A: Target 50+ customers by Series A, no single customer >20% revenue, multi-year contracts reduce churn.

## Funding Timeline

```
Month 0:     Start with personal $0-10K
Month 1:     Apply for NSF SBIR Phase I
Month 4:     Dataset released, first revenue
Month 6:     Angels/grants ($25-50K) if needed
Month 12:    Seed round ($500K-1M) decision point
Month 18:    NSF SBIR Phase I received ($50K)
Month 24:    Series A ($3-5M) OR bootstrap path
Month 30:    NSF SBIR Phase II ($500K) if bootstrapping
```

## Recommendation

**Best path for most founders**:

1. **Months 0-6**: Bootstrap ($13.5K personal)
2. **Months 6-12**: Angels/grants ($25-50K) if helpful
3. **Months 12-18**: Decision point
   - If growing fast (>30% MoM) → Raise Seed ($1M)
   - If steady growth → Bootstrap + SBIR
4. **Months 18-36**: Scale to $1-2M ARR
5. **Month 36+**: Series A ($3-5M) OR stay profitable

**The insight**: You don't NEED VC money. This business can bootstrap to $2M ARR, then raise from position of strength or stay independent.

Raise when it ACCELERATES growth, not when you NEED money.
