## 📊 At a Glance

**Problem**: Foundation models need millions of manipulation demonstrations. Current cost: $420K per robot task.

**Solution**: Pay people $2-4/hour to perform everyday tasks while collecting finger-level manipulation data.

**Advantage**: 10-40× cheaper than robot teleoperation, higher diversity, naturally human-like demonstrations.

**Go-to-Market**:
1. Release 100-hour dataset FREE (like DROID, RH20T)
2. Build credibility as "the dexterous data people"
3. Monetize via custom collection services ($20/demo)

**Capital Required**:
- Phase 0 (Validation): $1,500
- Phase 1 (100-hour dataset): $5,000
- Phase 2 (Release): $2,000
- **Total**: $8,500 to full validation

**Timeline to Revenue**: 6 months

**Year 1 Revenue Target**: $135K (Months 6-12)

**Exit Potential**: $300M-1B acquisition (Physical Intelligence, Skild, NVIDIA, Amazon)

## 📚 Background Research

This opportunity emerged from analysis of:
- 800+ robotics papers (2020-2025)
- 50+ funded robotics startups
- $12B+ in robotics funding data
- Deep dive on Scale AI business model

Key insight: Robotics has a **data collection problem**, not an algorithms problem. We're solving the bottleneck.
