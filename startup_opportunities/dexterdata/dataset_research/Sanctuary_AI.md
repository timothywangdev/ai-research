- Strong manufacturing partnerships for data collection
- Well-funded with strategic investor base
- Tactile sensors already integrated (addresses some hand data needs)

**Complementary Opportunities:**
- Sanctuary focused on manufacturing tasks, not comprehensive hand skills
- Teleoperation expensive and slow for collecting diverse manipulation data
- DexterData could provide pre-training data to accelerate Carbon AI
- Different market focus: manufacturing vs. medical/research/broader applications

### Market Opportunities

**What DexterData Could Offer:**

1. **Diverse Hand Manipulation Pre-Training:**
   - Sanctuary collecting manufacturing-specific tasks
   - DexterData offers broader manipulation dataset
   - Pre-training on diverse hand skills → faster manufacturing task learning
   - Complement Sanctuary's domain-specific data

2. **Accelerated Training Pipeline:**
   - Current: weeks to 24 hours for new tasks
   - DexterData pre-training could reduce further
   - Rich manipulation priors enable faster fine-tuning
   - Especially valuable as Sanctuary scales to thousands of robots

3. **Tactile Data Benchmarking:**
   - Sanctuary has tactile sensors but limited public data
   - DexterData could provide baseline tactile datasets
   - Enable comparison and validation of Sanctuary's approaches
   - Research community needs tactile manipulation benchmarks

4. **Non-Manufacturing Applications:**
   - Sanctuary optimizing for manufacturing
   - Healthcare, research, home applications need different data
   - DexterData serves use cases Sanctuary won't prioritize
   - Potential to license Phoenix platform with DexterData training

5. **Academic Research Access:**
   - Sanctuary data fully proprietary
   - Universities studying manipulation need alternatives
   - DexterData enables research Sanctuary's closed system prevents

### Licensing/Access Gaps

**Sanctuary's Closed Ecosystem:**
- All training data proprietary
- Carbon AI system not available externally
- Teleoperation data from Magna deployment confidential
- No announced plans for data licensing or sharing

**Gaps DexterData Can Fill:**

1. **Research Community:**
   - Academics can't access Sanctuary's manufacturing data
   - Need open alternatives for tactile manipulation research
   - Phoenix hardware expensive ($50K+ estimated), DexterData affordable

2. **Competing Platforms:**
   - Other humanoid companies can't buy Sanctuary data
   - Need training datasets for their own robots
   - DexterData provides platform-agnostic training data

3. **Adjacent Industries:**
   - Medical robotics: different tasks than manufacturing
   - Surgical training: requires different skill demonstrations
   - Service robotics: cooking, cleaning, personal care
   - Sanctuary won't serve these markets directly

   - Sanctuary = domain-specific (manufacturing)
   - DexterData = domain-general (manipulation skills)
   - Foundation models need broad pre-training + specific fine-tuning
   - DexterData provides the broad base, Sanctuary adds specificity

4. **Tactile Sensing Alignment:**
   - Both recognize tactile data importance
   - DexterData gloves capture similar modalities to Phoenix sensors
   - Could become de facto tactile manipulation benchmark
   - Research community needs standardized tactile datasets

5. **Cost/Speed Advantage:**
   - Gloves cheaper and faster than full teleoperation
   - For pure hand tasks, gloves more efficient
